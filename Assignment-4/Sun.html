        <ol>
            <li>The sun is a massive ball of hot plasma that serves as the central star of our solar system</li>
            <li>It is approximately 4.6 billion years old and will continue to shine for about 5 billion more years</li>
            <li>The sun is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with nuclear fusion in its core producing energy.</li>
            <li>This energy travels through space as light and heat, making life on Earth possible.</li>
            <li>The sun's surface, called the photosphere, has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius.</li>            
            <li>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are powerful eruptions on the sun's surface that can impact Earth's magnetic field.</li>
            <li>The sun's gravity is so strong that it keeps all the planets, moons, and other objects in the solar system in orbit.</li>
            <li>Light from the sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, traveling at the speed of light.</li>
            <li>Without the sun, Earth's temperatures would plummet, and the planet would become uninhabitable.</li>
            <li>Solar energy, harnessed through technologies like solar panels, is a renewable and clean source of power for humanity</li>
        </ol>
